Use javac for comliplation
being platform independent java can be compiled and run on any os. I used linux (Fedora);

for checking version of java installed write in linux terminal or command prompt windows [java -version]

for compilation syntax == in terminal or comand prompt write [javac class_name.java]  //class name of main method
for interpreting and calling jvm and jre executing the program write [java class_name]

when created userdefined package for compiling write [javac -d.class_name.java] //class name of main method 
for interpreting [java user_defined_package_name.class_name] //class name of main method
